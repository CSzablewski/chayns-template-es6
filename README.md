# chayns+ES2015 Template

This template will show you the basic project structure for building your own custom Tapps with `ES2015` and the `chayns`-Framework.

## Getting started

The template is based on several npm-Packages, which have to be installed first. If you havenÂ´t installed `node.js` already, please install it now.
For installing the dependecies you have to open your `node.js` terminal, change the path to the cloned project and run:

```
npm i
```

For setting up the recommended folder structure you just have to run:

```
npm run setup
```

This project uses `webpack` and `Babel` for building and debugging. You can start the `webpack-dev-server` with the following statement:

```
npm start
```

For creating an production build execute this code:

```
npm run release
```
